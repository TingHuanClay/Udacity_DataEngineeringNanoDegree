# Project: Data Pipelines with Airflow
---
## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

Developer is responsible for knowledge on Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. You'll deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.

### Data Sets
Developer will be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:


- **<em>Song dataset</em>**: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
<br>
JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.<br>All files are nested in subdirectories under */data/song_data*.<br>Below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

- **<em>Log dataset</em>**: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`
<br>
log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.<br>The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month.<br>All files are nested in subdirectories under */data/log_data*. <br>Below is an example record in log files:

```
{"artist":"Des'ree","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Kaylee","gender":"F","itemInSession":1,"lastName":"Summers","length":246.30812,"level":"free","location":"Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1540344794796.0,"sessionId":139,"song":"You Gotta Be","status":200,"ts":1541106106796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/35.0.1916.153 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"8"}
```

## Database Schema
The schema used for this exercise is the Star Schema:
There is one main fact table containing all the measures associated to each event (user song plays) and 4 dimension tables.


#### Fact Table
**<em>songplays</em>** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
- songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables
**<em>users</em>** - users in the app
- user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

**<em>artists</em>** - artists in music database
- artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

**<em>songs</em>** - songs in music database
- song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

**<em>time</em>** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
- start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project structure

Files used on the project:
1. **README.md** provides discussion on the project.
2. **dags/udac_sparkify_dag.py** The main DAG for the ETL process.<br><br>
3. **plugins/operators/create_tables.py** define CreateTablesOperator to create the Redshift tables for ETL.
4. **plugins/operators/stage_redshift.py** define StageToRedshiftOperator to copy data from s3 to staging tables in redshift.
5. **plugins/operators/load_fact.py** define LoadFactOperator to process data and insert into the fact table.
6. **plugins/operators/load_dimension.py** define LoadDimensionOperator to process data and insert into the dimension tables.
7. **plugins/operators/data_quality.py** define DataQualityOperator to validate the result of the ETL process.<br><br>

8. **plugins/helpers/create_table_statements.py** define create table sql statement for CreateTablesOperator.
9. **plugins/helpers/sql_queries.py** define create table sql statement for LoadFactOperator and LoadDimensionOperator.


### Brief ETL Pipeline Introduction

### How to run
1. Create a Redshift cluster in Postgres



2. run the command to start the Airflow webserver
   `/opt/airflow/start.sh`

3. Use Airflow UI to configure your AWS credentials.

```
Conn Id: aws_credentials
Conn Type: Amazon Web Services
Login: Enter your Access key ID from the IAM User credentials you downloaded earlier.
Password: Enter your Secret access key from the IAM User credentials you downloaded earlier.

```

4. Use Airflow UI to configure your connection to Redshift.<br>
Value of **Conn Id** and **Conn Type** is firmed.
Other settings depends on the setting you did when creating the redshift cluster.

```
Conn Id: redshift
Conn Type: Postgres

Host: Enter the endpoint of your Redshift cluster, excluding the port at the end.
You can find this by selecting your cluster in the Clusters page of the Amazon Redshift console.
See where this is located in the screenshot below. 
[IMPORTANT] Make sure to NOT include the port at the end of the Redshift endpoint string.

Schema: Enter dev. This is the Redshift database you want to connect to.

Login: Enter awsuser. This is the user name you created.

Password: Enter the password you created when launching your Redshift cluster.

Port: Enter 5439.

```

5. Turn on the DAG **udac_sparkify_dag** and execute it
